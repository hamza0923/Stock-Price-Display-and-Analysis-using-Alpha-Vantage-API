# Stock-Price-Display-and-Analysis-using-Alpha-Vantage-API
This project allows you to analyze historical stock prices using the Alpha Vantage API and visualize the data in a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. You can select a stock from a dropdown menu, view its closing prices over time, and perform linear regression analysis to predict future stock prices.
